      <p>The following is an annotated bibliography of the sources I used in writing this blog.</p>

<!--Faust, Avraham, and Shlomo Bunimovitz. “The Four Room House: Embodying Iron Age Israelite Society.” _Near Eastern Archaeology_, vol. 66, no. 1/2, 2003, pp. 22–31. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3210929.

<p><strong>Ronald A. Simkins, “The Widow and Orphan in the Political Economy of Ancient Israel,” <em>The Bible, the Economy, and the Poor</em>, Edited by Ronald A. Simkins and Thomas M. Kelly, Journal of Religion &amp; Society Supplement 10, 2014. 20-33. <a href="http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/toc/SS10.html">http://moses.creighton.edu/JRS/toc/SS10.html</a>. Accessed 26 September 2017.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Widow and Orphan in the Political Economy of Ancient Israel&rdquo; examines the role of widows and orphans in ancient Israel, and the place that religious laws and texts had in creating that role. The laws protected landless widows and orphans, who could not provide for themselves, by ensuring that others would provide for them through gleanings and tithes. Religious texts also forbade others from oppressing this vulnerable group and specified that their god, YHWH, would take care them. However, these laws also kept them on the margins of society; the widow and orphan remained dependent on others for survival, unable to subsist on their own labor. This source provides valuable information about my character&rsquo;s social group and how he might have interacted with other members of society.</p>

<p><strong>Stern, Philip. “Assyrian March Against Judah.” <em>HistoryNet</em>. 23 June 2016. www.historynet.com/assyrian-march-against-judah.htm. Accessed 26 September 2017.</strong></p>

<p>In &ldquo;Assyrian March Against Judah&rdquo;, author Philip Stern describes the Assyrian invasion of Judah in the year 701 B.C.. While this article primarily focuses on the conflict between Sennacherib of Assyria and Hezekiah of Judah, it also provides information about that conflict may have affected other residents of Judah. Since Mizpah is so close to Jerusalem, it is highly likely that it and its inhabitants were affected by Sennacherib&rsquo;s seige of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><strong>Von Waldow, H. Eberhard. “SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN EARLY ISRAEL.” <em>The Catholic Biblical Quarterly</em>, vol. 32, no. 2, 1970, pp. 182–204. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43712795.</strong></p>

<p>This journal article describes the feelings of social responsibility that prevailed in ancient Israel and explores why such sentiments may have developed. It is useful to my research primarily because it explores why certain groups were unusually vulnerable. At the time, security came from kin and extended family, so those outside of a kinship group were vulnerable. Foreigners had left their kinship group and its protection; orphans and widows had been linked to the group by a individual who is now deceased, leaving their status in question.</p>

<p><strong>Dougherty, Raymond P. “Sennacherib and the Walled Cities of Judah.” <em>Journal of Biblical Literature</em>, vol. 49, no. 2, 1930, pp. 160–171. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3259107</strong></p>

<p>This article examines textual and archaeological evidence of King Sennacherib&rsquo;s invasion of Judah in 701 B.C. Since this blog will explore the possible effects of that invasion, the information that “Sennacherib and the Walled Cities of Judah.” provides about the extent of the damage and how it was accomplished is highly useful. In addition, this article briefly describes the walls of Tell en-Nasbeh, or Mizpah.</p>

<p><strong>Faust, Avraham. “The Rural Community in Ancient Israel during Iron Age II.” <em>Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research</em>, no. 317, 2000, pp. 17–39., www.jstor.org/stable/1357482.</strong></p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Rural Community in Ancient Israel during Iron Age II&rdquo;, author Avraham Faust describes the villages of ancient Israel. He looks into the basic social unit - the family - as well as food preparation, terraces, storage facilities, and community organization. Mizpah is a town rather than a village, but many aspects of life, such as the importance of agriculture and the centrality of the family, remain the same whether one lives in a large city or a small settlement.</p>

<p><strong>Shafer-Elliott, Cynthia. “Biblical Bread: Baking Like the Ancient Israelites.” <em>Bible History Daily</em>, Biblical Archaeology Society, 29 July 2015. www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/daily-life-and-practice/biblical-bread-baking-like-the-ancient-israelites/. Accessed 6 November 2017.</strong></p>

<p>This article describes recreating a tannur oven of the sort used in ancient Israel and using it to bake bread. It is an interesting example of experimental archaeology, and one that furthered my knowledge of food preparation in that time and place.</p>

<p><strong>Faust, Avraham, and Shlomo Bunimovitz. “The Four Room House: Embodying Iron Age Israelite Society.” <em>Near Eastern Archaeology</em>, vol. 66, no. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, 2003, pp. 22–31. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3210929.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Four Room House: Embodying Iron Age Israelite Society&rdquo; focuses upon the structure, function, and importance of the four-room house in ancient Israel. It provides information about the layout of a four-room house and the purpose of each room, which helped me narrate the typical day of someone who lived in one.</p>

<p><strong>Jennie Ebeling. “Engendering the Israelite Harvests.” <em>Near Eastern Archaeology</em>, vol. 79, no. 3, 2016, pp. 186–194. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5615/neareastarch.79.3.0186.</strong></p>

<p>This resource describes the role of women in the agricultural harvests of ancient Israel, as well as details about the harvests themselves. It is primarily useful to this project for its descriptions of the grape harvest and how women contributed to it.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel D. Pioske. “DAVID&rsquo;S JERUSALEM: A Sense of Place.” <em>Near Eastern Archaeology</em>, vol. 76, no. 1, 2013, pp. 4–15. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.5615/neareastarch.76.1.0004.</strong></p>

<p>This article focuses upon Jerusalem in the 10th century B.C., but its descriptions of agriculture, housing, and cities are useful to understanding daily life in Iron Age Israel in general.</p>

<p><strong>“Manasseh, King of Judah.” Anchor Bible Dictionary, edited by David N. Freedman, Gary A. Herion, David F. Graf, John David Pleins, and Astrid B. Beck, 1993.</strong></p>

<p>This dictionary entry described King Manasseh and his reign. It describes the differences between him and his father Hezekiah, and mentions a possible coregency as a way to reconcile seemingly inconsistent chronologies.</p>

<p><strong>King, Philip J. and Lawrence E. Stager. Life in Biblical Israel. Westminster John Knox Press, 2001.</strong></p>

<p>This book was the source of Figure 2, the cake mold. It also provided a great deal of information about daily life in Israel, and about the Queen of Heaven in particular.</p>

<p><strong>Novacek, Gabrielle V. Ancient Israel: Highlights from the Collections of the Oriental Institute. The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, 2011.</strong></p>

<p>This was the source of Figure 1, the female figurine. This book also provided information about goddess-centered cults, such as that of the Queen of Heaven.</p>
