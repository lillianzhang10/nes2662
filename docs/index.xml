      <description>Part Three The walk back was largely uneventful, but a familiar face greeted Shimeah at the gate. His cousin Tirzah, a diminutive girl with curly hair, held a bundle of firewood under one arm and waved at him with the other. Despite her parents&amp;rsquo; insistence that she avoid Shimeah, she frequently conversed with him and treated him as a favored playmate. She slowed down, waiting for Shimeah and Naarah to reach her.</description>

      <description>Part Two Shimeah and Naarah arrived at the vineyard. Healthy grapevines trailed along stone-free ground, and a thorny hedge surrounded the area to protect them from being trampled. Further up the hill, there was a juice-stained winepress and a stone watchtower. Some clusters of grapes remained here and there, but most of them had been harvested and processed into wine. A husband and wife stood by the winepress, loading skins and jars of fermenting wine onto a donkey.</description>

      <description>Part One Shimeah awoke as the horizon was starting to brighten with dawn light. He sat up from his sleeping pallet and surveyed the room. This dimly-lit chamber was on the second floor of his three-room house, and it served as the sleeping quarters for him and his mother, Naarah. Aside from him, the room was empty. His mother probably woke earlier to grind flour and knead dough. The pleasant scent of baking bread wafted upwards from the first floor; drawn by it, he climbed down the wooden ladder and headed over to the food preparation area.</description>

      <description>Main Topics The examination of Shimeah&amp;rsquo;s daily life will primarily focus upon the grape harvest and his interactions with his extended family. Secondary topics will include food processing and storage, the structure and function of the four-room house, and the lingering effects of Sennacherib&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Judah. For most of the day, Shimeah will glean grapes from harvested vineyards alongside his mother Naarah. He will also begin to process the harvested grapes into wine.</description>

      <description>Introduction Meet Shimeah. He is a 10-year-old boy who lives in Mizpah with his mother, Naarah, during the year 693 B.C.. His father died 8 years ago, when Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah in 701 B.C., leaving Shimeah an orphan and Naarah a widow. As a fatherless child, he is partially protected by laws that require Judahites to leave gleanings in their field for the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, but he is still part of a socially and economically disenfranchised group.</description>
