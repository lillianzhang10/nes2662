      <description>The examination of Shimeah&amp;rsquo;s daily life will primarily focus upon the grape harvest and his interactions with his extended family. Secondary topics will include food processing and storage, the structure and function of the four-room house, and the lingering effects of Sennacherib&amp;rsquo;s invasion of Judah. For most of the day, Shimeah will glean grapes from harvested vineyards alongside his mother Naarah. He will also begin to process the harvested grapes into wine.</description>

      <description>Shimeah awoke as the horizon was starting to brighten with dawn light. He was on the second floor of his three-room house, in the room that served as sleeping quarters for him and his mother, Naarah. The pleasant scent of baking bread wafted upwards from the first floor; drawn by it, he climbed the ladder down and headed to the food preparation area. There he found his mother sticking flat pieces of dough to the outside of an cone-shaped oven.</description>

      <description>Introduction Meet Shimeah. He is a 10-year-old boy who lives in Mizpah with his mother, Naarah, during the year 693 B.C.. His father died 8 years ago, when Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah in 701 B.C., leaving Shimeah an orphan and Naarah a widow. As a fatherless child, he is partially protected by laws that require Judahites to leave gleanings in their field for the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, but he is still part of a socially and economically disenfranchised group.</description>
