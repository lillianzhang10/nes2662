"The Widow and Orphan in the Political Economy of Ancient Israel" examines the role of widows and orphans in ancient Israel, and the place that religious laws and texts had in creating that role. The laws protected landless widows and orphans, who could not provide for themselves, by ensuring that others would provide for them through gleanings and tithes. Religious texts also forbade others from oppressing this vulnerable group and specified that their god, YHWH, would take care them. However, these laws also kept them on the margins of society; the widow and orphan remained dependent on others for survival, unable to subsist on their own labor. This source provides valuable information about my character's social group and how he might have interacted with other members of society.

__Stern, Philip. “Assyrian March Against Judah.” _HistoryNet_, 23 June 2016, www.historynet.com/assyrian-march-against-judah.htm.__

In "Assyrian March Against Judah", author Philip Stern describes the Assyrian invasion of Judah in the year 701 B.C.. While this article primarily focuses on the conflict between Sennacherib of Assyria and Hezekiah of Judah, it also provides information about that conflict may have affected other residents of Judah. Since Mizpah is so close to Jerusalem, it is highly likely that it and its inhabitants were affected by Sennacherib's seige of Jerusalem.

__Von Waldow, H. Eberhard. “SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN EARLY ISRAEL.” _The Catholic Biblical Quarterly_, vol. 32, no. 2, 1970, pp. 182–204. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43712795.__

This journal article describes the feelings of social responsibility that prevailed in ancient Israel and explores why such sentiments may have developed. It is useful to my research primarily because it explores why certain groups were unusually vulnerable. At the time, security came from kin and extended family, so those outside of a kinship group were vulnerable. Foreigners had left their kinship group and its protection; orphans and widows had been linked to the group by a individual who is now deceased, leaving their status in question.
