## Part One

Shimeah awoke as the horizon was starting to brighten with dawn light. He sat up from his sleeping pallet and surveyed the room. This dimly-lit chamber was on the second floor of his three-room house, and it served as the sleeping quarters for him and his mother, Naarah. Aside from him, the room was empty. His mother probably woke earlier to grind flour and knead dough. The pleasant scent of baking bread wafted upwards from the first floor; drawn by it, he climbed down the wooden ladder and headed over to the food preparation area. There he found his mother sticking flat pieces of dough to the interior walls of an cone-shaped oven - a tannur. The wood inside the tannur crackled merrily as it burned, heating the sides of the oven so that they were hot enough to cook the dough.

"Good morning, Shimeah," she greeted.

"Good morning," he yawned.

"Go fetch us something to drink while I finish cooking," she said.

Obediently, Shimeah went to the back rooms they used for storage. Simple, undecorated storage jars were lined up next the walls alongside cooking pots, flasks, and various other pieces of pottery. He picked up a jug of watered-down wine, and peered at the pale liquid inside. The beverage inside probably consisted of more water than wine, but it was still preferable to drinking plain water from a spring or cistern. He returned to Naarah with the ceramic jug, and together they ate a simple breakfast of warm bread and weak wine.

After the meal, they headed out from the house and made their way along the ring road. A few neighbors were also awake and about: a pair of youths herded sheep and goats along the street, and a child walked past carrying a jar of spring water on her head. Shimeah and his mother left the town through the gate complex and trekked towards the vineyards to the north and east. Summer had turned into autumn, and the grape harvest was concluding. Many vineyards had already been fully harvested, and the only grapes remaining there were those deliberately left for the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow. In other words, the grapes were left for people like Shimeah and Naarah. Naarah was widowed eight years ago, when her husband Jeremoth died defending Jerusalem from Assyrian invaders. Shimeah wasn't quite an orphan, but he was too young to support them on his own, so they gleaned for the food that they could not produce themselves.

As they walked, they passed orchards planted upon terraced hillsides. When King Sennacherib of Assyria attacked Judah, Mizpah had not fallen, but it had not escaped unscathed either. The Assyrian armies often chopped down the trees of their enemies, and even eight years later, the orchards outside town were still recovering. Saplings stretched upwards from the ground, young and frail, but with the potential to produce abundant harvests in the years to come. The olive trees had started to fruit just last year, and it would be several more years before they were fully mature. In contrast, the date palms would require decades of growth before they bore fruit. There were also terraces lined with the stumps of dead trees; not everyone had been able to replant after the destruction of their livelihood.
