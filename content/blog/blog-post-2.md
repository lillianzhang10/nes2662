## Main Topics

The examination of Shimeah's daily life will primarily focus upon the grape harvest and his interactions with his extended family. Secondary topics will include food processing and storage, the structure and function of the four-room house, and the lingering effects of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah. For most of the day, Shimeah will glean grapes from harvested vineyards alongside his mother Naarah. He will also begin to process the harvested grapes into wine. Because the fig and pomegranate orchards outside the city walls are still recovering from being damaged by invading armies 8 years ago, he does not attempt to glean from them even though they're harvested at roughly the same time as grapes. Throughout the day, he will meet and interact with various members of his Bet'Ab who are going about their daily lives. His grandfather, the patriarch of the clan, dislikes Shimeah because his mother is originally from Gibeah and not Mizpah, and expresses his disdain by favoring his other grandchildren and daughter-in-law over them.

I chose to focus on the grape harvest because agriculture was central to the lives of people in ancient Israel, and because I was curious about the numerous laws regarding leaving gleanings for the socially disenfranchised. The extended family was the basic social unit, so it also played a critical role in people's daily lives, as well as their treatment or social status. Finally, the long-term implications of an enemy invasion intrigue me, so I wanted to explore how the effects of the Assyrian invasion might still be felt years after it occurred. 

## Shimeah's Family

{{< figure src="/familytree.png" caption="Figure 1: Shimeah's family tree" >}}

* Elidad is the patriarch of the clan, and Shimeah's grandfather. He originally wished for his second son, Jeremoth, to marry within the clan, and he dislikes Naarah because she's originally from Gibeah instead of Mizpah. As a result, he treats Shimeah and Naarah poorly, refusing to share the crops produced by the land that Shimeah will inherit.
* Haggith is married to Elidad. They have four children: two sons and two daughters.
* Abiel is Elidad's oldest child and Shimeah's uncle. He is married to Ahlai, his second cousin. They have two daughters and one son.
* Jeremoth is Elidad's second child and Shimeah's father. He died while defending Jerusalem from Assyrian invaders, leaving behind his wife and son.
* Naarah is Shimeah's mother. She was originally from Gibeah, but has since moved to Mizpah and joined her late husband's Bet'Ab.
* Sheerah is Elidad's third child, and Shimeah's aunt. She married Ishpah, another resident of Mizpah, and joined his Bet'Ab. They have one son, with another child on the way.
* Miriam is Elidad's youngest child, and Shimeah's aunt. She is unmarried and looking for a husband.
