## Part Three

The walk back was largely uneventful, but a familiar face greeted Shimeah at the gate. His cousin Tirzah, a diminutive girl with curly hair, held a bundle of firewood under one arm and waved at him with the other. Despite her parents' insistence that she avoid Shimeah, she frequently conversed with him and treated him as a favored playmate. She slowed down, waiting for Shimeah and Naarah to reach her.

"Hi, Shimeah! Hello, Aunt Naarah!" she greeted as she fell into step alongside them.

"It's nice to see you, Tirzah," Naarah replied.

"You have lots of grapes," she observed, peering at the baskets they carried.

"We do!" Shimeah grinned. "We're going to go home and dry them on the rooftop to make raisins."

Suddenly, Tirzah fell silent and darted back to the inner gate, hiding behind the wall that formed one of its chambers. Shimeah’s confusion only lasted a moment – then Tirzah’s father Abiel and her siblings Gera and Zeruiah walked past them. The two children glanced towards Shimeah and Naarah but did not greet them. Abiel didn't even spare them a glance; instead, he moved as far to the other side of the narrow street as he could and walked faster. His children trailed behind his like obedient ducklings. A sense of alienation hung in the air, heavy enough to choke upon. When her family had passed, Tirzah emerged from her hiding spot and rejoined Shimeah and Naarah.

"Sorry," she apologized. "My dad doesn't want me to talk to you. I can't let him see me here."

"It's not your fault," Shimeah said. 

"It isn't fair," Tirzah continued. "You and Aunt Naarah are nice. Why should everyone in the family be mean to you?"

Shimeah looked down at his dusty sandals, awkward and uncertain. “Grandma Haggith doesn’t like us very much.”

“Why not?” Tirzah demanded.

“My mom and I worship the Queen of Heaven, and Grandma Haggith thinks that no one should worship any gods besides the Lord. She was 
really unhappy when Grandpa Elidad let my dad marry my mom, and she told everyone else in the family to stay away from us.”

“That’s a dumb reason.”

“Well, she also doesn’t like that my mom is from Gibeah, not Mizpah. And they have different opinions about King Hezekiah and King 
Manasseh. The Queen of Heaven is the main reason, though.”

“I don’t care about any of that. We can still be friends, right?”

Shimeah beamed at her. “Right.”

Haggith was a strict Yahwist; she worshipped YHWH alone. Naarah worshipped YHWH as one deity among many, and taught Shimeah to do the same. They also had different opinions about Hezekiah and Manasseh, who may have been co-regents during this time. Hezekiah was a reform-minded king who tried to centralize religion and ban worship of deities like the Queen of Heaven. Manasseh did not share the opinions of his father and would later revert many of his reforms. These religious and political differences drove a wedge between them, causing Haggith to use her influence to turn her children away from Naarah and her son.

This dictionary entry described King Manasseh and his reign. It describes the differences between him and his father Hezekiah, and mentions a possible coregency as a way to reconcile seemingly inconsistent chronologies.
