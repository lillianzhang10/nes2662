Welcome. This blog was created as a course requirement for Cornell University's NES 2662: Daily Life in Biblical Times. Each blog post presents preliminary work done in preparation for a final term paper about a day in the life of someone from Iron Age Israel.

This website was generated by Hugo and hosted by Github Pages. The theme is Hugo Future Imperfect, ported from HTML5 UP's Future Imperfect by Julio Pescador.
