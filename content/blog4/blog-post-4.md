## Part Two

Shimeah and Naarah arrived at the vineyard. Healthy grapevines trailed along stone-free ground, and a thorny hedge surrounded the area to protect them from being trampled. Further up the hill, there was a juice-stained winepress and a stone watchtower. Some clusters of grapes remained here and there, but most of them had been harvested and processed into wine. A husband and wife stood by the winepress, loading skins and jars of fermenting wine onto a donkey. In previous weeks, they and their extended family had temporarily moved into the watchtower in order to harvest and tread grapes. It had been a joyful occassion, accompanied by music and singing. Now the celebration was over, and all that was left to do was to transport the fruits of their labor back and let it ferment.

"Good morning!" Naarah called out. 

"Hello!" the other woman said.

"Thank you for letting us glean from your vineyard," Naarah said. 

"There's no need to thank us. We're just following the laws," the woman replied.

"We'll be taking these back to our house," the man said, indicating the jars and wineskins. "You can pick grapes as you like, and you may use the winepress once we're done here."

"Truly, thank you," Naarah said. "Not everyone is so kind."

Shimeah nodded, and added, "You're really nice."

The woman smiled sadly at the sight of him. "It's the least we can do. We lost someone precious to us during the invasion too."

Without another word, she turned and led the donkey down the hill. Her husband followed closely behind.

Shimeah and Naarah gathered up their tools and began to harvest. Using pruning knives, they separated clusters of grapes from the vines and collected them in baskets. Shimeah grew bored after a little while, so he started to snack on the grapes they were picking. Although grapes were primarily useful for making wine, they could also be eaten fresh. Sometime before noon, the vineyard owners returned with the donkey and took the last of the storage containers, leaving the winepress available for Shimeah and Naarah to use.

They gathered up the baskets of grapes and dumped them onto the treading floor of the winepress. Barefoot, they tread upon the grapes to crush them and release the juice. Rivulets of purple liquid ran through a channel in the winepress and pooled a vat below, where yeast from the skins was already beginning to cause fermentation. They would leave the juice to bubble and ferment in the vat for a few days. Then they would collect the liquid in wineskins and storage jars that had small holes for ventilation and leave it in a cool, dark place to continue the fermentation process.

<!--Isaiah 5:2New International Version (NIV)

2 He dug it up and cleared it of stones
    and planted it with the choicest vines.
He built a watchtower in it
    and cut out a winepress as well.
Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,
    but it yielded only bad fruit. -->
